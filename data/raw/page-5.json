Downtown LA is brimming with opportunities for college students: internships, dining, nightlife and more. Freshmen must live on campus, and they are allowed to have cars. That\u2019s a good thing, because the campus is within an hour's drive of big-time attractions like Venice Beach, Disneyland and Sunset Strip in Hollywood. Parking on campus is free with a permit, and about two-thirds of students bring cars. Students can choose from more than 100 clubs and organizations to get involved in on campus. Occidental has a handful of social sororities and fraternities, a gender neutral organization and a multicultural sorority. Even more students compete on the school\u2019s sports teams, the orange and black Tigers, which are members of the NCAA Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Occidental students can also take classes at <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/pasadena-ca/cal-tech-1131\">CalTech</a> and <a href=\"http://premium.usnews.com/best-colleges/art-center-college-of-design-1116\">Art Center College of Design</a>, and can earn joint degrees at <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/pasadena-ca/cal-tech-1131\">CalTech</a>, <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/new-york-ny/columbia-university-2707\">Columbia University</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/los-angeles-ca/usc-1328\">University of Southern California</a>'s Keck Graduate Institute.</p><p>This liberal arts college is notable for its diverse undergraduate student body; about 50% of students are Caucasian, about 15% are Asian and another 15% are Hispanic, and about 5% are Black. Women make up more than half&nbsp;of the student population. </p><p>Occidental\u2019s picturesque campus has been featured in many motion pictures, including \"Clueless,\" \"Orange County,\" \"Jurassic Park III\"&nbsp;and&nbsp;\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.\" Notable alumni of the small school include Marsha Evans, former president and CEO of the American Red Cross; Andrea Elliott, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the New York Times; and Robert Richter, a documentary producer whose work has been featured on major stations like PBS and the Discovery Channel.

English pounds to start the school now known as Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. These days, the institution is a well-regarded liberal arts college home to top-notch research and innovative student programming. One unique component of life as an F&amp;M student is the \"Harry Potter\"-esque living situation. All first-year students are assigned to one of five college houses, known as Bonchek, Brooks, Weis, New and Ware. Each house is overseen by faculty members called dons and prefects. In each College House, students live together, share meals and plan and attend events. First-year students must live in their college house. Sophomores,&nbsp;juniors and seniors can choose to as well. In addition to activities through the college houses, students can choose from roughly 90 clubs and organizations, including nearly a dozen fraternities and sororities. The Greek system draws more females than males; about 20% of men join, compared to about 30% of women. The F&amp;M Diplomats sports teams are members of the NCAA Division III Centennial Conference and are especially competitive in men\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s lacrosse. Academic and extracurricular life stops each Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 12:35 p.m. for Common Hour, a small window of time for students and faculty to attend a campuswide lecture, movie snippet or event.</p><p>The tree-lined campus is in walking distance of downtown Lancaster\u2019s main attractions. Stores and restaurants stay open late for First Friday, a lively celebration at the end of the first week of each month. On Third Fridays, art galleries and performance centers typically host shows. Students can also check out a Barnstormers game at the city\u2019s baseball stadium or shop for groceries and crafts in Central Market, the country\u2019s oldest continually operating farmer\u2019s market. For a more metropolitan experience, Philadelphia is about 1.5 hours away.</p><p>Students can get involved in research projects early at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. The school receives more than $500,000 a year for projects, and research fairs in the fall and spring showcase student-faculty projects. Students are also encouraged to study abroad; the school offers programs in 200 locations around the world, and about half of the student body studies abroad each year. Notable alumni of the college include Denis Cortese, emeritus&nbsp;president and CEO of the Mayo Clinic; Kenneth M. Duberstein, Ronald Reagan\u2019s former chief of staff; and Mary L. Schapiro, former chairperson of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-liberal-arts-colleges", "displayName": "National Liberal Arts

Bikers may enjoy the 36-mile trail that connects Granville to the nearby Ohio cities of Newark, Johnstown and Alexandria. The state capital, Columbus, is about 25 miles away, and students can get there in the free Big Red Express shuttles, which run three days a week. All students must live on campus, unless they are married, have children, are over the age of 25 or commute from a nearby parent\u2019s home. Freshmen will only live with other first-year students. Close to 30 percent of students are involved in Denison\u2019s Greek system, which comprises about 15 fraternities and sororities. There are more than 150 student clubs and organizations on campus. Student athletes compete as the Denison Big Red in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference, but the school does not have an official mascot, despite frequent attempts by students to find one. More than three quarters of students play sports at some level. Besides playing or cheering for sports teams, students can catch performances by famous musicians like Yo-Yo Ma in the Vail Series or get a quick cooking lesson from a faculty member during the on-campus Chowder Hours.</p><p>Students can get on-the-job experience before graduation with the help of the robust Denison Internship Program. To hone effective skills before entering&nbsp; the job market, students can enroll in several leadership initiatives at Denison, including a six-day retreat called LeaderShape. Notable Denison alumni include actors Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner, former Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes and geologist Kirtley Mather, who named Mount Denison in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Peninsula after the university.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-liberal-arts-colleges", "displayName": "National Liberal Arts Colleges", "displayRank": "#44", "displayScore":

Trinity also has a field station in Ashford, Conn., where students and faculty research subjects in the natural and environmental sciences.

trimesters, at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. On the trimester schedule, students take three classes per term and have an extended winter break. All freshmen, who live in residence halls, are randomly assigned to one of seven Minerva Houses, an academic and social community. Upper-class students and faculty can reside in this community. All students can take classes and participate in extracurricular activities in the houses. Each house has its own kitchen for students who want to cook their own meals. There are more than 100 student clubs and organizations, including more than 15 fraternities and sororities. Most Union sports teams, called Dutchmen, compete in the NCAA Division III Liberty League. The Union men\u2019s and women\u2019s ice hockey teams compete in the Division I ECAC Conference Hockey League. The school mascot is a costumed man known as Dutch. Students can volunteer in the revitalizations efforts going on in downtown Schenectady. New York is about 150 miles away, and more than 60 percent of students travel abroad before graduation. Union College\u2019s global offerings include year programs, trimester stays and three-week trips known as mini-breaks. Each year, students celebrate the changing seasons at Springfest, a day of concerts by famous performers like Sean Kingston and Matt Nathanson.</p><p>In addition to its undergraduate majors, Union College offers accelerated professional degree programs in conjunction with other schools. Students can graduate with a law degree from <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/items/03101\">Albany Law School</a> in six years, or with a medical degree from <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/items/04069\">Albany Medical College</a> in eight years. There are additional master\u2019s degree accelerated programs in the business and education fields. Among the notable graduates of Union College are several famous television and movie producers: Alan Horn, chairman of The Walt Disney Studios; Rawson Marshall Thurber, who made \"Dodgeball\" and \"Magnum, P.I.\"; and Ilene Landress, executive producer of \"The Sopranos.\" Other distinguished alumni include Kate White, former editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan magazine; Richard Templeton, CEO of Texas Instruments; and Baruch Samuel Blumberg, who discovered the Hepatitis B virus.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-liberal-arts-colleges", "displayName": "National Liberal

Students with a specific career path in mind can enroll in the Management Fellows, Media Fellows or Science Research Fellows programs, which pair academics with semester-long internships and series of speakers.

After class, students can get involved in more than 100 student organizations, and nearly 70 percent participate in Greek life. The Greek system, which has about 25 fraternities and sororities, has existed since 1845.

For shorter trips within Tennessee, the campus is a 45-minute drive from Chattanooga and 90 minutes from Nashville.</p><p>The university is owned and governed by dioceses of the Episcopal Church, and it is the only school in the country to bear this distinction. However, the university is open to students of all faiths. Students with high GPAs are inducted into the Order of the Gownsmen and receive priority selection for dorm rooms and classes. Notable alumni of The University of the South include Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham, National Geographic photographer Stephen Alvarez and dozens of esteemed clergymen, including the Most Rev. Edmond Browning and the Most Rev. John Maury Allin, former presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-liberal-arts-colleges", "displayName": "National Liberal Arts Colleges", "displayRank": "#47", "displayScore": "73", "maxPossibleScore": null, "sortRank": 47, "noteText": null, "noteCharacter": null, "rankStatus": "ranked", "isTied": true}}, {"primaryKey": ["national-liberal-arts-colleges", "overall", "3803"], "institution": {"footnote": "This school declined to fill out the U.S. News & World Report main statistical survey.

activities are a big part of student life at Whitman College, a liberal arts institution in the rural small town of Walla Walla, Washington. Students come out in droves for intramural sports - about 70 percent compete on some team - and Greek life. Though the school only has a handful of sororities and fraternities, about a third of the student body is involved in the Greek system. About 20 percent of students compete on the Whit varsity sports teams, all members of the NCAA Division III Northwest Conference. If going Greek or playing sports isn\u2019t your thing, there are more than 100 other student clubs and organizations to check out, too. The campus has an indoor rock climbing facility, where students can climb for fun or for course credit. Outdoor recreation lovers can also earn academic credits in unique courses such as glacier mountaineering, kayaking or wilderness skills. The student Outdoor Program coordinates just-for-fun recreation trips, too, like moonlight sea kayaking and whitewater rafting. Students at Whitman can also take advantage of the school\u2019s western location by enrolling in the unique Semester in the West program, a three-month journey through Oregon, Nevada, California, Utah and Idaho in a converted horse trailer.</p><p>Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, which is three blocks from downtown Walla Walla. The town is rich in local charm and home to the popular Walla Walla Balloon Stampede, an annual parade of hot air balloons. Located in southeastern Washington, Walla Walla is not in close proximity to any major towns, but students can get to Spokane, Washington., in 2.5 hours; Portland, Ore., in four hours; and Seattle in 4.5 hours. Students begin and end their education at Whitman in unique fashion: All freshmen must take a two-semester transition program into a liberal arts education called Encounters, and all seniors must complete an assessment before graduation which typically includes an oral component.</p><p>In addition to the 45 majors offered through the college, Whitman students can earn a combination undergraduate/graduate degree at select prestigious universities across the country. Interested students complete three years at Whitman before transferring to <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/durham-nc/duke-university-2920\">Duke University</a>, for example, for a two-year graduate program in forestry or environmental management. Notable alumni include actor Adam West of \"Batman\" fame; John Markoff, a New York Times journalist; and Matthew Ames, director of research at the Mayo Clinic.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-liberal-arts-colleges", "displayName": "National Liberal Arts Colleges", "displayRank": "#47", "displayScore": "73", "maxPossibleScore": null, "sortRank": 47, "noteText": null, "noteCharacter": null, "rankStatus": "ranked", "isTied": true}}], "lockedItems": [], "powerreviews": {"api_key": "62b03fb4-af47-41d4-a424-ed23c7ebdb14", "merchant_group_id": "78870", "merchant_id": "34933"}, "isPremium": false, "previewableRanking": false}, "utag_data": {"site_vertical": "education", "site_portal": "highereducation", "page_type": "rankinglist", "content_type": "product", "site_product": "bestcolleges", "site_product_section": "rankings", "site_product_subsection": "nationalliberalartscolleges", "rankinglist_type": "Best Liberal Arts Colleges", "buttons": ["col_compass_BC_ranking_blurb", "col_compass_sat_GPA", "col_compass_table_scores", "col_compass_lrail_GPA", "col_compass_lrail_score", "col_compass_lrail_diver", "col_compass_lrail_sport", "col_compass_lrail_gender", "col_compass_pubvpriv", "col_compass_lrail_setting", "col_compass_freemium_rankings"], "stitial_fact": "Upward of 304,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. during the 2014-2015 academic year."}, "tealium_environment": "prod", "meta": {"rel_next_page_url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/api/search?_sort=rank&_sortDirection=asc&schoolType=national-liberal-arts-colleges&_page=6", "rel_prev_page_url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/api/search?_sort=rank&_sortDirection=asc&schoolType=national-liberal-arts-colleges&_page=4", "robots": ["noindex", "follow"], "og:type": "webpage", "og:url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges?_page=5", "site": "Best Colleges", "zone": "Rankings/Liberal Arts", "usn_content_type": "", "canonical_url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/api/search", "title": "2021 Best National Liberal Arts Colleges p 5 | US News Rankings", "description": "Compare the top national liberal arts colleges in the U.S. Learn more about the best national liberal arts colleges to find the right school for you.", "og:title": "The 10 Best Liberal Arts Colleges in America", "og:description": "See how the top national liberal arts colleges rank at US News.
